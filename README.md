# Task Flow Web-App

A feature-rich task listing application built with Vanilla JavaScript, following object-oriented programming principles and separation of concerns for a clean, maintainable codebase. List your sub-steps to complete your project and get started on it!

## Features

- **User Management**: A user has an editable name for a personalized experience and a set of projects.
- **projects**: Organize tasks into "projects" (groupings of similar to-dos), making it easy to categorize tasks. Each project functions as a separate to-do list.

  - **Create New Project**: Add a new category for organizing to-dos.

  - **Rename User**: Edit the user's name easily.
  - **View To-Do Details**: Open a detailed view for each to-do to see more information.

## Technical Details

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: The app is built with OOP principles to ensure modularity and maintainability.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Code structure carefully separates logic, making each part of the app independently manageable and enhancing readability.
- **Local Storage Integration**: To retain user data between sessions, including to-do lists, projects, and user settings.
