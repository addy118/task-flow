# To-Do List Web-App

A feature-rich to-do list application built with Vanilla JavaScript, following object-oriented programming principles and separation of concerns for a clean, maintainable codebase.

## Features

- **User Management**: A user has an editable name for a personalized experience and a set of collections.
- **Collections**: Organize tasks into "collections" (groupings of similar to-dos), making it easy to categorize tasks. Each collection functions as a separate to-do list.
- **Default Collection**: Every user is provided with a default *General* collection to get started quickly.
- **Task Modals**: The app includes interactive modals for smooth task management:
  - **Create New Collection**: Add a new category for organizing to-dos.
  - **Create New To-Do**: Quickly add to-dos within any collection.
  - **Rename User**: Edit the user's name easily.
  - **View To-Do Details**: Open a detailed view for each to-do to see more information.

## Technical Details

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: The app is built with OOP principles to ensure modularity and maintainability.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Code structure carefully separates logic, making each part of the app independently manageable and enhancing readability.
- **Local Storage Integration**: To retain user data between sessions, including to-do lists, collections, and user settings.
- **Dates**: To input dates via date-picker and show them on todos for better productivity.
